## Project Description 🚀
In this project, I set up a wifi captive tunneling system using the MyPublicWiFi software and configured port forwarding to a local IP address. I then deployed a Flask application on our local server and redirected incoming links from the wifi domain to the Flask application, allowing users to access and run the application through the wifi network. This project provides a clear mini model of how cloud computing architecture works, and showcases the ability to efficiently set up and deploy a Flask architecture.

## Technical Details
To set up the wifi captive tunneling system, I used MyPublicWiFi software which allows us to create a wireless access point and redirect traffic to a captive portal. I configured the captive portal to redirect traffic to our Flask application, which was deployed on a local server using PyCharm. To ensure that incoming links were directed to the correct port, I configured port forwarding to the local IP address of the server.

## Skills Gained 🤓
Through this project, I gained experience in networking, server setup, and Flask development. I was able to efficiently execute the project in just 2 hours, demonstrating our skills in setting up and deploying Flask architecture.
